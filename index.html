                    <h3>Bottle Filling Simulation</h3>
                    <p>This is a simulation of a Bottle Filling process on a conveyor. It is written in structured text using TwinCAT's 3 TcXaE shell which is  basically a Visual Studio Interface without all traditional IT languages capabilities. Its visualization is also provided.

					<h2><strong>ABOUT</strong> </h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a control systems and process control enthusiast. I am well adept with industrial controllers such as PIDs, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and PACs. I also use computer tools such as MATLAB and SIMULINK to simulate responses of given systems and also for PID tuning.
                    </br> I have programmed soft PLCs using software such as WPLsoft for Delta PLCs and also run industrial simulations such as tank filling and sorting items on a conveyor belt on software such as FactoryIO. Recently I have done a bottle filling simulation using Beckhoff TwinCAT 3.

					<h2> <strong>WEBINARS ATTENDED</strong> </h2>
                    <h2>Loop Tuning </h2>
                    <p>
                            Engineering Institute of Technology
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            This was a webinar held by EIT where we were taught the basics of PID loop tuning and getting the correct gains for a PID controller for a given process.  </p>

                    <h2>Industrial Automation, Industry 4.0 and Smart Factories </h2>
                    <p>
                            Engineering Institute of Technology
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            This was a webinar also held by EIT where we were taught about incorporating technologies such as IoT in  Industry 4.0 even as we look onto Industy 5.0 which is already in motion.  </p>

                    <h2>Data-Centric Evolving Power Grid </h2>
                    <p>
                            Engineering Institute of Technology
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Basics involving the Data Centric architecture and how it can be incorporated into power grids were taught in this webinar by one of EIT's deans, Dr. Steve Mackay </p>
